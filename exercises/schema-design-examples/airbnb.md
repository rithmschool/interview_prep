# AirBnB Schema Design

For this exercise, you should design a database schema for AirBnB. You can play around with their website to get a sense of some of the functionality. Here are some features to think about. These are intentionally worded vaguely:

1. Users can create accounts and log in.
1. Users can reserve a place to stay.
1. Users can create a listing for a place they'd like to rent out.
1. Listed properties have amenities, and the ability to "tour this house."
1. Properties have reviews.
1. Renters have reviews.
1. You can contact the owner of a property and start a conversation.
1. You can create different lists in the "saved" section of your profile.
1. You can "heart" properties as you're looking at them to add them to any one of your lists.

There's plenty of other functionality too, but this should be more than enough to get you started!
