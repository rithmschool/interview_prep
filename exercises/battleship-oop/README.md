# OOP Battleship

Design an OOP Battleship game using JavaScript. Your focus should be on deciding what classes and methods to implement. Actually implementing all of the functionality can be considered a bonus. 

For some background, here are the rules of the game.

1. The game is for two players, and is played on two 10x10 grids. Each player has their own grid.
2. Each player begins the game with five ships, of the following lengths: 5, 4, 3, 3, and 2. (For simplicity, you can assume that the ships are placed randomly on the player's board to start the game.)
3. Players take turns firing missiles onto their opponent's grid, in an attempt to sink their opponent's ships.
4. After each strike, the player receives learns whether they hit their opponent or missed.
5. If an opponent's ship is sunk, this is also announced to the player. (e.g. "You sunk your opponent's ship!")
6. Whoever sinks all of their opponent's ships first wins the game.

To get the solution running, `cd` into the `solution` folder, `npm install`, and run `node index.js`.
