### Tracks

1 - Google/Top companies
2 - Startups / Larger companies
3 - Review fundamentals

### Things we need to think about / ideas
- Most students will not get dramatically better in 4 weeks 
- We should assume students have no idea how to manage their time
- Whiteboard problems (and 2 instructors mock interview each other)
- Make sure non-technical time is VERY structured (everyone should be going through that process)
- Each morning would be a "part" of an interview
- Teach higher ROI concepts (how does it all fit together)
- Helping students build a mental model around all of this stuff

### Things we should implement
- An initial assessment to see where students are at
- No tech curriculum for everyone, make tracks for students based on a 1:1 convo and assessment

### Notes from Haseeb
- 1:1 coaching (more on non technical side)
- Don't focus on resume until after company projects, but make sure students have one and don't do it from scratch
- Make technical stuff optional, but give problem as takehome then solve the next day 
- Tell every student that each interview is an opportunity to learn and assume that you (the student) will fail
- Talk about what happens when you don't know the answer - so important to teach
- Make sure students get 50-100 applications out over the 4 weeks so they can experience tons of rejection while still with us
- We have to make them feel like they're making progress
- Have students bcc us on every job application (send screenshot) / cold email and followup (app academy did this, they never really checked the emails but used them as a reference and it helped students stay accountable)
- Give students small projects for their tasks (CSS, React, Backend, etc.)
- Always an imperfect application (always apply on the earlier side)

#### Behavioral Exercises / Lectures
- Role play coffee date / asking for coffee and what to say 
- Cold email exercise
- Role play phone screen / behavioral interview prep
- focus on self care and mindset  
- telling your story
- How to handle rejection

#### Technical Lecture Topics
- Systems Design
- Integration of data structure and algorithms 
- Talking when not knowing the answer (and have a technical list of all tools to try to solve stuff)- **so important to teach**
- How everything we've learned fits together
- Systems design / integration 
- Teach pattern matching - see it done well 
- Technical concepts review (REST, HTTP, caching)
- Stories and mental models to say smarter things and inferences
