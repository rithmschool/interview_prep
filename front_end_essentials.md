- falsey values in JS
- reference vs value 
- `NaN`
- `==` vs `===`

- [Codewars Problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_rU5Z0Lc9yKJqXX9zAIIl1QdokPYlj5A6v3PJXXvWy4/edit 	)

#### Next steps - these are must knows but only after the fundamentals

- higher order functions + callbacks
- forEach, map, filter
- some, every, find, findIndex
- hoisting
- timers (setInterval / setTimeout)
- IIFE
- DOM manipulation using jQuery or vanilla JS

#### Intermediate JS - these are must knows for interviews, but make sure there is 100% confidence in the topics above before continuing here

- testing with JavaScript (mocha/chai)
- reduce
- promises
- es2015 (arrow functions, let/const, class keyword, destructuring, object shorthand notation)
- closures
- `this`
- `call` / `apply` / `bind`
- `new`
- Constructor Functions
- Prototypes
- Inheritance
- OOP Terms (abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation)
- Event loop

#### Advanced JS - may show up in more difficult interviews, good to know conceptually, wonderful if you can implement/use it

- currying
- composing
- JS performance / memory leaks
- more advanced testing (karma / jsdom)
- es2015 (generators, map, set)
- design patterns
- immutability
